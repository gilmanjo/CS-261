# CS 261 - Data Structures - Homework - Spring 2016

Git repository for all my homework completed for this course.  Contains skeletons provided by the instructor with solutions that I have filled in.  I think this will provide a *decent* example of some basic data structures that you may use in your implementations.  My solutions may not always be the most efficient or elegant, but they are written as I completed the assignments during this course.
